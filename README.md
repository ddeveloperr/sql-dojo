## Learning technologies is a marathon. As a professionals we need to learn continuously, consistently, constantly and endlessly. The main goal of this repo is making systematic collection of examples, exercises, and projects. 
## The content will be short, clean, searchable, squeezed out of the selected books, tutorials, and my own 10+ years experience. You can find it quickly and shere it with the world :).

## Key words an phrases:
SQL hands-on exercises | SQL examples | SQL skills | SQL by doing | Learn SQL by building mini projects | T-SQL | SQL Server | PostgreSQL | MySQL | RDBMS | Database
